    <strong>I used to just memorize the Git commands.</strong> I didn’t know them. I didn’t understand </br>them.I just ran the commands my teammates said to run. Any time something went wrong,</br> I had to ask our Git Master to fix it.
    <p></p> This was silly. Git is something I use <u>every day</u>. I needed to learn it to make my</br> development workflow smoother and more efficient.<br><br>

    Over the past five years I’ve spoken to conferences, given workshops, and trained </br>teams to use Git effectively. I took all of that experience and put it into this video course </br>to guide you from <span id="gitInitTwo">git init </span>to Git Master.
    <br><br>
    We need to get back to the basics of writing code for other humans. This is the goal </br> of Getting Git.
